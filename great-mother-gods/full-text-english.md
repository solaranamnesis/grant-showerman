# 1\. The Introduction of the Cult of the Great Mother at Rome.

The introduction of the Sibylline Books during the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus* is significant in the history of Rome as marking the point at which the native religion began to be arrested in its natural development and to be transformed under the influence of the religions of the East. It is true that the presence of the Greeks in Italy and the West, through a trade which was considerable, had had its effects on the Roman commonwealth even before this. The Servian constitution bears the marks of the Greek system*; the system of weights and measures of the Romans had been brought into relation with that of the Sicilian Greeks*; the Greek alphabet had been communicated through intercourse with Cumae*; the statue of the Aventine Diana of the Latin confederation had been formed after the image of the Artemis of Ephesus at Massilia.* But the intercourse between the Romans and the Italian and Sicilian Greeks was purely commercial, and though its effects are not difficult to see in the less conservative departments of Roman life, in all that pertained to the inner and deeper life of the commonwealth Greek influence was still operating from a distance. Pliny refers the making of the first statue of the gods to the time of Tarquinius Priseus, and Varro says that none existed up to the time of Servius Tullius.* So far was the Roman worshiper from investing divinity with human form and human attributes, as the Greek did, that for nearly two centuries the symbolism of a flint for Jupiter,* or a lance for Mars,* or a fire for Vesta* was the highest flight his imagination took, while the host of other deities --- and they were as numerous as the acts and duties of the worshiper's life --- remained entirely abstract and formless. The acquisition of the Sibylline Books, then, occurred at a time when Rome had practically no acquaintance with the religions of the East; and the event may be regarded as the first pronounced step in the process which finally resulted in the denationalization of the old-Roman religion and the enthronement of a _turba deorum_ whose worship was not in harmony with the genius of the early Romans, and which came to be in harmony with the genius of the later Romans only by reason of the change which that genius gradually underwent. The introduction of the Books is to be regarded primarily as a manifestation in the development of a new religious system; as a cause it is to be regarded only in so far as it facilitated that development in a peculiar manner.

The Books came to Rome from Cumae, and to Cumae they had come from Erythrae, whither they had been brought from Gergis, near Mt. Ida.* The fact of their having come from the neighborhood of Mt. Ida is not unimportant; for, consulted as they were "when insurrection had arisen, or some great calamity in war had befallen the city, or great marvels and visions hard to understand had occurred,"* it often happened that the remedy they prescribed was the introduction of a new cult; and the Books were uniformly partial to those cults which were well known on or near Mt. Ida, their old home.

First among foreign divinities to be introduced through the Sibylline Books was Apollo, who, though the first temple to him was not dedicated until 431 B. C, became known simultaneously with the introduction of the Books.* The institution of the _ludi Apollinares_ in 212 B. C. was also due to the same influence. Mercury, to whom a temple was. dedicated in 495 B. C, followed. In 493 a temple was dedicated to Ceres in connection with Dionysus and Kora, who were identified with the Liber and Libera of the _indigitamenta_, and the _ludi Cereris_ were instituted. Proserpina also, not known in the _indigitamenta_ as having any connection with the lower world, became identified with Persephone. In the _lectisternium_ of 399 B. C., the first in the history of Rome, and ordered by the Books, the participants were Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and Neptune, showing that Latona had been introduced, that Greek Poseidon was worshiped as Neptune, and that Diana and Hercules were identified with Artemis and Heracles. _Dispater_, to whom and Proserpina the altar in the Terentos was consecrated, is another divinity introduced through the Books, which also caused the _ludi saeculares_ to be instituted. In 293 B. C., in consequence of a plague raging among the people, the Books were again consulted, and gave direction to call to Rome the god Aesculapius, and that divinity was established two years later in a temple on the island in the Tiber. He had been worshiped at Rome before this, but outside the _pomerium_,* where foreign cults were regularly assigned places unless there was special reason for making them completely national. The _Floralia_, whose character was entirely out of accord with the genius of the old Roman religion, were instituted in obedience to the Books in 238 B. C., and mark the metamorphosis of the native Flora. Juventas, the Greek Hebe, had a _lectisternium_ in 218 by direction of the same authority; and Aphrodite appeared first in Roman affairs in 217, when, by recommendation of the Books, a temple was vowed to Venus Erycina. In the _lectisternium_ of the same year, also ordered by the Books, were six _pulvinaria_, with the following divinities: Jupiter and Juno, Neptune and Minerva, Mars and Venus, Apollo and Diana, Vulcan and Vesta, Mercury and Ceres* --- a system of twelve corresponding to the Greek system. What with the identification of old Roman divinities with strange gods from abroad, and the introduction of other cults entirely new, Rome had taken to herself all of importance that the Greek system offered. Her next acquisition was of necessity to be made elsewhere.

The _lectisternium_ of 217 B. C. was held at a time not far removed from the disaster at Trasimenus. The following year was marked by the still more alarming defeat at Cannae. In 215 the death of Hiero of Syracuse deprived Rome of a faithful ally, and in the person of his successor gave the Carthaginian a friend. Tarentum fell in 213, and the list of disasters was interrupted only by the taking of Syracuse by Marcellus in 212. The current now turned, and the capture of Capua in 211, the recapture of Tarentum in 209, and above all the battle of the Metaurus in 207 made it clear that the Roman cause was not lost. But the war had lasted nearly twelve years and had been thoroughly exhausting to Rome. The coinage had been debased; rich and poor had for years been called upon to make sacrifices for the support of the army; payment in all departments was in arrears; fields lay waste even outside the actual theatre of war; prices had risen to thrice their wonted height; and Latium itself, before the Metaurus, had begun to waver.* The victory over Hasdrubal brought a tumult of rejoicing, but when this had subsided, the task confronting the wearied people hardly seemed smaller than before. The invincible Hannibal was still in Italy, and there was need of no less energy now that the war was to be offensive rather than defensive. It was a time when a recommendation of the Books was sure to meet with prompt obedience; and their intervention resulted in the introduction of a cult the history of which from its earliest inception in the East to its fall before Christianity in the fourth century A. D. it is purposed to trace in the following pages.

The consuls for the year 205 B. C., the fourteenth of the war, were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Publius Licinius Crassus. Scipio was fresh from his command in Spain and was urgent for an African expedition, but met with opposition from the conservative party in the Senate. While the debate was still undecided, the decemvirs, consulting the Sibylline Books on account of the very frequent showers of stones that year, came upon a carmen which said that whenever an enemy from an alien land should wage war on Italy he could be expelled thence and conquered if the Idaean Mother should be brought to Rome from Pessinus. Simultaneously with the report of the decemvirs to the Senate came the report of a legation which had made a pilgrimage with gifts to Delphi. The entrails had been auspicious, and a voice had come from the shrine telling them that the Roman people were about to win a victory far greater than that from the spoils of which (probably Metaurus) the legates bore gifts. This coincidence, together with the thought of Scipio, who had demanded Africa as his province as though his soul were prescient of the end of the war, decided the course of the Senate. The Romans at that time had no allies in Asia, but the friendship of Attalus of Pergamum had been secured in the war which they had aided him to carry on against Philip, and they looked to him for aid in effecting the transfer of the goddess. An embassy of five citizens of note was selected, and five quinquiremes were voted them. Visiting Delphi on their way, they were assured that they would receive aid from Attalus, and were also directed to provide for the reception of the goddess in behalf of the State by the "best" man at Rome, Arrived at Pergamum, the king received them cordially, conducted them to Pessinus, and handed over to them the sacred stone --- _lapis quidam non magnus, ferri manu hominis sine ulla impressione qui posset, coloris furvi atque atri, angellis prominentibus inaequalis_* --- which the natives of the place said was the Mother of the Gods.* The object of their mission attained, the legates sent one of their number in advance to report the fact to the Senate and to communicate the will of the oracle in regard to the reception of the divinity. Publius Scipio Nasica, the son of the Gnaeus Scipio who had fallen in Spain, a youth not yet arrived at the quaestorial age, was selected as the best man in the State, and commissioned to meet the goddess at Ostia. The day of the arrival was made a holiday; the foremost matrons of Rome, among them Claudia Quinta, whose reputation had suffered from slander, but whose fame became more brilliant after the ministry of that day, received the goddess from Scipio's hands; and as by turns they carried her to the city the whole commonwealth thronged to meet them, censers were placed before the doors wherever they passed, incense was burned, and prayers were offered that propitiously and with good will the goddess would enter the city. Arrived at Rome, she was borne to the temple of Victory on the Palatine, inside the _pomerium_, contrary to the usual practice on the introduction of foreign divinities. The date was the day before the Nones of April, 204 B. C. The people in great numbers brought gifts, there was a _lectisternium_, and games called _Megalensia_.*

*) Arnob. Adv. Nat VII 49.

*) Varro L. L. VI 15 gives Pergamum as the city whence the image was brought. Cf . Ovid Fast. IV 265 sq. This view, however, is not shared by other authorities, and Pessinus is thought of throughout the history of the cult as the ancient seat of the image.

This is the historian's account, and is an attempt to give a faithful picture of the first scene in the history of the cult at Rome. The Mother appears as a dignified Roman deity. The account of the poet differs in that it introduces the marvellous and invests the scene with the attributes of the worship as it was in the time of its full development in the East.* According to the poet's version, the coming of the Mother is the final act in the Trojan emigration; she had wished to come with Aeneas, but the fates had decreed otherwise, and she had remained content with giving him her trees for his ships.* Attains is not willing to grant the Romans their desire; they plead their kinship with Aeneas, and his coming to Rome;* the earth trembles and rumbles, and the goddess herself speaks:

Ipsa peti volui. Ne sit mora. Mitte volentem.  
Dignus Roma locus quo deus omnis eat.*  

After her long journey by sea along the storied coasts of the Mediterranean, she finds assembled to meet her at the Tiber's mouth the knights, senators, and common people, with mothers, daughters, and Vestals in the front. The ship is drawn into the mouth of the stream by cables, but in vain are the efforts to move it far; the water is low, and the ship becomes fast in the marshy shallow. Confusion seizes the multitude at the omen; the ship is as firm as an island. Claudia Quinta, of noble birth and as beautiful as she is noble, chaste but not untouched by slander, steps forth from the line of mothers, daughters, and Vestals,* dips her hands into the waters of the Tiber, sprinkles thrice her head, lifts thrice her palms to the heavens, kneels to the goddess, strong in the consciousness of her own purity, and with hair no wing loose, calls upon her for vindication from the charges of her enemies. Then rising, with only slight exertion she draws the sacred craft up the stream, while the multitude sends cries of joy to the skies.

But night falls before they have reached Kome, and they halt at a bend of the river. The following morning they burn incense, sacrifice a heifer before the garlanded stern, and continue the journey. Arrived at the Almo, a small stream which flows into the Tiber not far south of Rome, a hoary priest clad in shining vestments laves the goddess and the sacred utensils in its waters, while his attendants utter wild cries to the frenzied music of flutes and the beating of the tympanum. Claudia precedes the multitude, and the goddess herself, in a chariot drawn by oxen bedecked with fresh flowers, is borne through the Porta Capena, where Scipio receives her.

*) Julian Imp. Or. V 160 and Aurel. Vict. Be Viris Illust. 46 call Claudia a Vestal, confusing her with Claudia Vestalis, daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, Consul 143 B. C. Herodian 1 11 mentions a Vestal as performing the miracle, but gives no name. Others are consistent in giving her merely as Claudia Quinta. Lact. II 7, 12, says of her: impudica e§set habita ob nimios corporis cultus; and Appian Hann. 56 tells us that she was charged with adultery, but not yet judged.

# 2\. The Great Mother in the East

The original home of the goddess who thus auspiciously took up her abode on western soil was within the limits of Asia Minor. It is true that among the Greeks, who saw in the Asiatic Mother their own Rhea, the ill-treated mother of Zeus, the idea was not uncommon that the latter had but transferred her seat from Crete to the more congenial wilds of Asia Minor*; but Demetrius of Scepsis, about 190 B. C., expressly denies that the worship of Rhea (meaning the Phrygian Great Mother) was either observed in or native to Crete, and says that it belonged only to Phrygia and the Trbad, and that those who asserted the contrary recited legend rather than fact. The homonymy of places is a cause of the confusion, he says; for there is a Trojan Mt. Ida and a Cretan Mt. Ida, _etc., etc._* But if there were those who, through confusion of the Asiatic Mother with Rhea, believed her to have come from Crete, the origin and growth of her worship is unanimously located in Asia Minor, in the central, western, or northwestern portions. Neanthes of Cyzicus attributed the founding of the cult in his city to the Argonauts,* and Herodotus represents the Cyzicenes as holding an annual festival in honor of the Mother of the Gods in the sixth century.* There was also a temple at Sardis, where the cult was of such long standing that the divinity was called by Herodotus [GREEK]*; and the various legends agree in locating the rise of the worship in Galatia, Phrygia, Lydia, or on the borderland between.*

*) Strabo 472.

*) Ibid. 45. Cf. Apollonius Rhodius Arg. I 1078-1152. 21 IV 76.

Notwithstanding the almost universal designation of the Mother as Phrygian in later times, she was not of Phrygian origin ethnographically. Ramsay has pointed out that the social and religious system of the Phrygian race, which invaded Asia Minor from the North about 900 B. C, was patriarchal, while the system of the native race which they conquered was matriarchal.* It is therefore probable that the Phrygians, on their entrance into the interior of the peninsula, found a deity whom the native inhabitants worshiped as a Great Mother, and that the later Phrygian Great Mother was only a development of that divinity.

The Great Mother, then, was really prePhrygian in origin, and can be called Phrygian only in a geographical sense. As late even as the transfer of the image to Rome she was not yet generally regarded as Phrygian. Apollonius Rhodius calls her [GREEK],* but the cult had its strongest center in Pessinus in Galatia, a city beyond the borders of Phrygia, which received its name, according to one legend, from having been the spot where the sacred stone fell ([GREEK]) from heaven.* Sophocles knows the Mother as the great goddess who rules by the Pactolus, a stream near Pessinus;* Pausanias and Arnobius, quoting early legends, call her [GREEK], from a mountain which the former calls Agclistis and locates near Pessinus, and which the latter calls Agdus*; an epigram in the Palatine Anthology designates her as [GREEK], the Sangarius being another stream near the city.* Other centers of her worship, less famous, were Cyzicus, where she was called [GREEK] and [GREEK], from the neighboring mountains Dindymon and Lobrinon*; the neighborhood of still another Mt. Dindymon, between Lydia and Phrygia, where Herodotus knew her as [GREEK]*; and Mt. Ida in the Troad, where she was called [GREEK].*

The name by which the Great Mother became commonly known to the Eomans and which is the usual modern designation, [GREEK], _Cybele_, occurs first on an altar near Prymnessus, inscribed _Matar Kubile_.* It is essentially a literary name, however, and is extremely rare in inscriptions. It makes its first appearance in literature in Pindar.* Aristophanes and Euripides use it, and it was so well known by the time of Strabo that he gave his version of its derivation. According to him, it is to be derived, like so many other designations of the Mother, [GREEK], and the [GREEK] from which this one was taken is a mountain or range of mountains.* Diodorus derives it from a mountain [GREEK].* Stephanus of Byzantium, s. v. [GREEK], calls [GREEK] a sacred mountain, from which [GREEK] is called [GREEK] and [GREEK]; and Hesychius and Suidas, understanding a range rather than a single peak, explain it as [GREEK].* The parallel form [GREEK], _Cybebe_, which became common among Latin writers, was used as early as the end of the sixth century B. C. by Charon of Lampsacus, quoted by Photius under the word [GREEK], with which he considers [GREEK] to be connected.* Still another form, [GREEK], appears in Hesychius.

To secure continuity and to avoid investing the purely Asiatic Mother with Greek or Roman characteristics, as sparing use as possible is made in this chapter of testimony not antedating the Roman visit to Pessinus, both as to names, character, and details of worship.

*) Ramsay Jour. Hell. Stud. Ill 35-41; V 244-216.

*) Frag. SO Bergk. It is foreshadowed, however, by the use in Hipponax, frag. 121 Bergk, of [GREEK], an adjective form.

*) 469; 470; 567: [GREEK].

Thus far the appellations cited have been almost without exception derived from localities where the cult of the goddess thrived. Among those derived rather from her character the most common is [GREEK].* Other designations and epithets in this Class are [GREEK].*

In a study of the character of the Great Mother and her worship before her cult had spread beyond the limits of Asia Minor, to approximate the truth is all that is possible; for our appreciation of the religion of early Asia Minor depends upon evidence given in the literature, art, and inscriptions of two foreign peoples, and that too given for the most part at a date late enough for the currents of outside influence to have had no small modifying effect. If Greek art, its elements borrowed from the East and perfected on its own soil, could early return and teach its progenitors, it is likely also that Greek religion early influenced that of the interior of Asia Minor. The Great Mother, therefore, cannot be seen in her purely Asiatic aspect. While that part of her nature which is agreeable is the more attractive when viewed in the golden light of Greek poetry, that part which is repulsive is no doubt also seen in an exaggerated form.

Orest. 1453; ibid. frag. 475, 13; Soph. Phil. 389; Apollon. Arg. I 1119; ibid. 1141; Orphic Hymns 30, 5 calls the Mother [GREEK], and Orph . Arg. 547 [GREEK].

The universal motherhood of the goddess is the feature of her character most frequently brought to the attention. She is Mother of the Gods , Great Mother, Mistress of All, Mother of All the Blest, Mother of All Gods and Ail Men, All-nourisher, All-begetter. She is Mother of Zeus himself. "The winds, the sea, the earth, and the snowy seat of Olympus are hers, and when from her mountains she ascends into the great heavens, the son of Kronos himself gives way before her, and in like manner do also the other immortal blest honor the dread goddess."*

She is thus the great parent of all nature. As Phrygia and its neighborhood, though a mountainous region, has also its rich, fertile valleys, she is as well a guardian over man and his interests in the form of flock ami herd and growing vegetation as over the untamed and uncultivated parts of the natural kingdom. But it is her character as a deity of wild nature that comes most prominently to view. She is the Mountain Mother, the Mighty Mother of Ida, the Divinity of the Mountains. She has a passion for the mountains, almost invariably has her sanctuaries on the mountains, and frequently takes her name from theinr Her usual designation [GREEK] is derived either from mountains or caves. She has places of worship in caves; Nicander mentions [GREEK], which are explained as [GREEK].* She has dominion over the sea and the winds; when the Argonauts founded her cult at Cyzicus, the halcyon was her messenger, and in her name foretold a calm. An altar of stones was reared to her there on the mountain, and the Argonauts made sacrifice garlanded with the leaves of the oak, which was sacred to her, while her image was fashioned from a vine.* The poet of _Hom. Hymns_ 14 addresses her as one who delights in the clamor of wolves and gleaming-eyed lions, in echoing mountains and woodland haunts. Anacharsis the Scythian worships her in a place [GREEK].* She is [GREEK], and lions are her faithful companions in literature and art throughout her history.* She is [GREEK], and [GREEK].* In the Phrygian legend given by Diodorus she cares for men and flocks, and there is a suggestion of the witch in her healing children by magic.* She herself as a child is exposed on the mountains, is nourished by wild beasts, and is associated with the satyr Marsyas in her mad wanderings. In _Anth. Pal._ VI 281 she is called on to hasten the maturity of the little Aristodice for the duties of wedlock. Finally, her universal power over the natural kingdom is nowhere more charmingly described than in Apollon. _Arg._ I 1140 sqq. : The trees showered down fruit in wondrous wise, and at their feet of her own accord did the earth send forth the blossoms of delicate herbage. And wild creatures, leaving their dens and the thickets, came forth fawning. And yet another wonder did she perform; for never before had Dindymon streamed with water, but at that moment did it jet forth before them unceasingly from the parched ridge.

Still more evidence as to the essential wildness of the Great Mother's character is found in the nature of her priests and their manner of worship. The mythical Idaean Dactyloi were the first to discover and forge iron, and had learned the art from their mistress, the Great Mother.* Her mythical attendants, the Corybantes, early became a synonym for what was noisy and orgiastic. 54 The Curetes, whose din of spear and shield at the birth of Zeus had drowned the infant's cries and saved him from Kronos, also became servants of the Mother upon her confusion with Rhea.* The actual priests of the goddess were called [GREEK], a name which the ancients explained as taken from the stream Gallus, which flowed into the Sangarius not far from Pessinus,* and on the banks of which the orgies of the Mother took place. The waters of the stream were fabled to inspire madness in those who drank of them.* The name Galloi first appears in the beginning of the second century B. C., in the Alexandrian epigrams of the _Anthologia Palatina_. The priests were further called [GREEK], sorcerers, [GREEK], dwellers in chambers (caves?) [GREEK].* They were eunuchs, were attired in female garb, and wore their hair, fragrant with ointment, wound in coils on the top of the head, letting it hang loose, however, while performing their orgies. Priests, and priestesses, who were as common as priests in the service ofthe Mother, often dedicated to the goddess their locks, which they had tossed wildly in the frenzied dance.* The attempt to derive Cybebe from [GREEK], the head, has been noted. Clothing and instruments, as well as hair, were sometimes dedicated.* Anacharsis the Scythian, attempting to introduce the worship among his countrymen, sacrificed [GREEK].*

*) Plin. JST. H. V 147, VI 4; Herodian 1 11. Movers Die Phoenizier 687 derives it from a Semitic root, and gives it a meaning similar to that of Corybas, Kopfschuttler, and KvfiijftoS. Stephanus s. v. Gallus relates that a Phrygian priest of that name in the service of the Mother, after having castrated himself in a frenzy, lay down by a stream, which was known thereafter as the Gallus.

*) Ovid Fast. IV 365.

*) Anth. Pal. VI 173, 220; IX 340.

The instruments used in the worship were no less in accord with the wild nature of the Mother. There was the [GREEK], flute, whose invention is credited to the goddess herself.* The [GREEK] were hand-clappers, or castanets, used in the dance.* Thirdly, there were the [GREEK], cymbals, brazen disks, hollowed and sharp-toned --- [GREEK].* Most frequently mentioned of all is the [GREEK], tympanum, described by Photius as [GREEK]. It was also described as [GREEK], and was native to Phrygia. 65 It was a necessary part of the equipment of a priest in the sixth century,* and Euripides calls it the invention of Dionysus and Rhea (Cybele), and of the Corybantes.* In _Anth. Pal._ the story is repeated several times of a Gallus who met a lion in a cave, frightened the savage beast by sounding his tympanum, and afterwards dedicated the instrument to the goddess.* Diogenes Tragicus mentions mitrewearing women of Asiatic Cybele, daughters of wealthy Phrygians, with tympana, rhomboi, and the clashing of brazen cymbals.* The rhombus mentioned here was an instrument of the drum or tympanum kind, but does not seem to have been common, at least in later times.* In Pindar appears also the torch --- [GREEK] --- indicating night celebrations, which may have been, however, a Greek addition.* All the instruments of the cult are classed as [GREEK], and served to inflame the ministers and worshipers of the goddess to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. Mad yelling was another feature of the worship. Nicander compares the shrieks of a madman to the curdling yell --- [GREEK] --- of a priestess of the Mother, which makes all shudder who hear.* A Gallus in the Palatine Anthology is [GREEK].* A place of worship is called [GREEK].* The frenzied excitement of priests is [GREEK] and [GREEK], and its culmination is self-scourging, or self-laceration with knives, to symbolize the supreme act of consecration to the Mother, which consisted in self-emasculation. The eunuch Alexis, after the ecstasy of the orgies, dedicates his sharp-voiced cymbals, his deep-toned flutes, made of the horns of a calf, his sonorous tympana, his yellow locks, tossed in the dance, and his knives, stained with red blood.* Epithets applied to the Galloi in token of their emasculation and chastity are [GREEK]. The act by which they deprived themselves of manhood and consecrated themselves to the service of the Mother was voluntary, and sometimes performed by their own hands when they were at the highest point of frenzied excitement.* The custom makes its first appearance, together with the Galloi, in Alexandrian literature, about 200 B. C., and was probably of Semitic origin.*

A complete account of the rites and festivals of the Great Mother while she was yet purely Asiatic, cannot be given. The Argonauts poured a libation to her over a blazing sacrifice, accompanying the rite with a dance in which they clashed together their shields and swords, from which Apollonius derives the use of the rhombus and the tympanum of his time.* A priestess in Nicander is called [GREEK], altar-attendant, and [GREEK], bearer of the [GREEK].* The Galloi are also called [GREEK], begging priests of the Mother, showing the manner in which the cult was supported.* Arrian says that the day of lamentation and the bathing of the Mother were Phrygian customs taken over into the Roman cult,* and it is probable that there was a series of festal days every spring in Phrygia as there was at Rome under the Empire, of which the bathing of the goddess in the stream Gallus occupied one day. Servius also states that the Romans worshiped according to the Phrygian manner,* but it is unsafe to invest the early cult in Asia Minor with all customs practised centuries afterward among a people so different from the eastern peoples as the Romans were.

Inseparably connected with the Great Mother is the strange being known as Attis. A study of the various versions of the legend in which he appears will serve to give a fuller appreciation of the character of the Mother as well as to show the relation which the two bear to each other. The legend first makes its appearance in the elegiac poet Hermesianax, about 340 B. C. It is given in abstract by Pausanias, and is meant to account only for the origin of Attis. Attis was the son of Calaus, a Phrygian, and was impotent from his birth. Arrived at the age of manhood, he migrated to Lydia, where he instituted the worship of the Great Mother. He was held in so great honor by the Lydians that Zeus in anger sent into their fields a savage boar, which destroyed Attis and also some of the Lydians. But, continues Pausanias, the Phrygians themselves do not believe this story. There is another legend among them, which says that Zeus in his sleep having discharged seed upon the earth, a monster having both male and female organs sprang into existence. Agdistis was the name given the monster, which was of such terror to the gods that they deprived it of male organs, from which in turn sprang an almond tree, from the effect of whose fruit the daughter of the river Sangarius bore a son. The child was exposed; but, having been cared for by a he-goat, it became beautiful surpassing the human, and inspired love in the breast of Agdistis. When this child, who was named Attis, was of suitable age, his kinsmen sent him to Pessinus to espouse the king's daughter; but during the nuptial hymn Agdistis suddenly appeared, whereupon Attis in a frenzy emasculated himself, his example being followed by the king. Agdistis, seeing the consequences of the madness which she had inspired in Attis, repented of her act, and prevailed upon Zeus to grant that the body of the youth should never decay nor waste. These are the best known legends about Attis, concludes Pausanias.* Elsewhere he states that the burial-place of Attis is on the mountain Agdistis at Pessinus.*

Another version, differing only in details, is given by Arnobius, a Christian writer of the fourth century, on the authority of a certain Timotheus, otherwise unknown to us, "and others equally learned who have drawn their information from recondite works on antiquity." The mountain here is called Agdus, instead of Agdistis, and it was in this place that Deucalion and Pyrrha created the human race, among whom was also the Great Mother. Zeus having been disappointed in his love for her, Agdistis comes into being as in the story of Pausanias, and is deprived of male attributes by a stratagem of Dionysus. From the blood springs a pomegranate tree, whose fruit, in the same manner as that of the almond in Pausanias, brings into being a child, called Attis for his beauty. His mother is Nana, the daughter of the river-god Sangarius; she is imprisoned by her father, who intends to starve her, but is nourished by her mother with apples and other food until the child is born. The Mother of the Gods and Agdistis are both enamored of the youth Attis, and the latter gives him in secret many gifts of the chase. Attis finally betrays the secret of their love while in wine. The king and his daughter are both named in this version --- they are Midas and la. On the occasion of the marriage, which he has planned in order to rescue Attis from the shameless love of Agdistis, Midas orders the city gates to be closed, but the Mother of the Gods, for the good of the youth, whose fate she knows, raises the walls of the city on her head and enters. Agdistis strikes madness into the entire company, and Attis, exhausted by his frenzy, at length throws himself down under a pine tree, emasculates himself, delivering to Agdistis the mutilated organs with the words: _tibi, Agdesti, haec habe, propter quae motus tantos furialium discriminum concitasti_. But the Mother buries them, and violets spring from them; and as for la, having enveloped the body of Attis in wool and mourned over him in company with Agdistis, she kills herself and is buried by the Mother, purple violets springing from her blood and the almond from her grave. The Mother bears the fatal pine into her cave and in company with Agdistis wildly laments the death of Attis. Zeu will not restore him to life, for that is against the will of the Fates, but he consents to allow the body of the youth to remain undecayed, his hair to continue to grow, and his little finger to move, whereupon Agdistis consecrates the body in Pessinus and causes it to be honored annually with priestly ceremonies.*

The above accounts are intended by their authors merely to present the origin of Attis, and the mention of the Mother is incidental. There is no need to suppose, with Rapp, that Agdistis and the Mother are identical, and that Arnobius has blended several accounts in ignorance of it. 85 The conception of the Great Mother as a monster like Agdistis, which this would imply, nowhere appears, nor does the conception of Attis as in any way a blood descendant of the Mother appear. The appearance of the Mother at the nuptials of Attis and la is not, as Rapp asserts, without motive; she is impelled by her love for the youth, and by her knowledge that he is fated to remain safe only as long as he is not bound by marriage ties --- _ne quid accideret maesti_. 86 Her behavior throughout is that of a protectress-lover, while the character of Agdistis exhibits nothing in common with that of the Mother. It is true that the Mother was occasionally known by the name of Agdistis, 87 but this points to a confusion of the legend of Attis' birth with the legend of his relations with the Mother, or it is an appellation derived from the rock Agdus, the scene of her creation by Deucalion and Pyrrha. The version of Arnobius is a blending of two tales, but not two tales presenting the same characters. He or his authorities blended, or found already blended by tradition, one legend of the birth of Attis and another legend of the relations of Attis and the Mother.

Still another account, given as Phrygian tradition, is found in Diodorus. In this version the Mother, rather than Attis, as in the others, is the principal character. The natives of that region, says Diodorus, tell in their myths that in olden times Meion was king of Lydia and Phrygia, and that having taken to wife Dindyme he became the father of a female child, which he exposed on a mountain called Kybelon. There by reason of a certain divine instinct did the panthers and other wild beasts which excel in strength come to the infant and nourish it; struck with the marvelousness of which occurrence a certain shepherdess of that region took up the child and cared for it, naming it Cybele from the place. Growing up the child excelled in beauty and wisdom, and was a marvel of quick intelligence. She was the first to devise the many-reeded syrinx, and invented for games and the dance the cymbals and the tympanum. Further, she devised means for the healing of animals and of little children; and indeed so many were the babes she saved by charms, and so fond was she of holding them, and so great was the zeal and the love she displayed in this way that she came to be called by everyone the Mountain Mother... Now Cybele, arrived at the flower of youth, loved a certain stripling of those regions called Attis then, but later also Papas, and having had secret relations with him, became pregnant. About this time the king and queen made the discovery that Cybele was their daughter, and she was received into the royal household. The father was at first ignorant of her relations with Attis, but soon discovering her fault, killed her attendants and her lover and cast forth their bodies unburied; whereupon Cybele, wild with grief for her lost lover and her attendants, became mad and rushed away to the fields, where alone and with locks flying loose, shrieking and sounding her tympanum, she went about the whole region. Marsyas, a cherished friend of her earlier days, became her companion, and it was during their wanderings that the famous contest with Apollo occurred; after which Apollo, enamored of Cybele, accompanied her even as far as the land of the Hyperboreans. But in Phrygia, a plague having fallen upon the people and the land having been smitten with famine, the unfortunate inhabitants consulted the god, and were bidden to entomb the body of Attis and to worship Cybele as divine. The body of Attis had disappeared through age, and so the Phrygians wrought an image of the youth, before which with lamentation and dirges they were accustomed to appease with proper honors the wrath of him they had illtreated; a thing which they perform even up to our time, adds Diodorus. On the altars of Cybele, established of old, they were wont to sacrifice each year; but afterward they erected a costly temple to her in Pessinus, held her in the highest honor, and made sacrifice to her on a scale most magnificent, Midas the king joining in with them. Beside her statue were placed panthers and lions in memory of her having been nourished by those animals. Such, then, concludes the writer, is the myth as related among the Phrygians.*

This version, it will be noticed,, contains nothing of the supernatural except the command of the oracle to entomb Attis and to give Cybele divine honors. Equally striking is the omission of the detail of emasculation, which was so prominent in the accounts of Pausanias and Arnobius, and which was so important in the practice of the cult itself.

Still more euhemeristic is the interpretation of Firmicus Maternus, 347 A. D., who attributes the origin of the Phrygian cult to a rich woman, or a queen, and a youth who despised her and on whom she wished to avenge herself.* Other accounts of the relations of Attis and the Mother, in which the latter is always a goddess and the former merely a beautiful youth, appear in Ovid, the philosopher Sallust, and the Emperor Julian.* In Ovid, Attis inspires a chaste love in Cybele, who enlists him in her service with the admonition to remain ever chaste. He pledges himself, but breaks his oath through love of the nymph Sagaritis, whom the goddess in anger destroys 5 whereupon the youth rushes in madness to the height of Dindymon, lacerates his body with a sharp flint, trails his locks in the dust, and finally castrates himself. Here the chasteness of the goddess and her ministers is emphasized, and the self-mutilation of Attis is consequently a penalty. Sallust represents Cybele as first seeing Attis lying on the banks of the stream Gallus, where she was inspired with love for him and gave him the [GREEK]. Attis returns to her service after his punishment. The account of Julian is the same, except that he represents Attis as having been exposed on the banks of the Gallus.*

When the cult of the Mother began to rise into prominence cannot be said. The record of _Marmor Parium_ 10, dating the appearance of the image of the Mother of the Gods and the invention of the flute by Hyagnis in 1506 B. C., shows only that the cult was of great antiquity in 264 B. C., when the record was inscribed. Homer knew vine-clad Phrygia and the banks of the Sangarius ; he knew Mt. Sipylus, another special haunt of the goddess, Mt. Ida, one of the most famed of her abodes, and Tereia, in the vicinity of Cyzicus; but he knew no Great Mother of the Gods.* The writer of _Hom. Hymns_ 14, on the contrary, knew intimately at least the external forms of the cult.

The so-called Niobe on Mt. Sipylus, now identified as the Mother, and two other reliefs near the tomb of Midas, in the vicinity of Prymnessus, dating from before the middle of the sixth century B. C., form the earliest definite evidence of the existence of the divinity.* In the time of Herodotus she was [GREEK] at Sardis, was established on Mt. Dindymon and at Cyzicus, and had the particular designation [GREEK] as well as the general [GREEK], and was worshiped by priests who had the tympanum in hand and wore images on their breasts.* By Sophocles' time Pessinus had become a center of her cult, and a century later her rites were solemnized in Caria by eunuchs, women, and flute and tympanum-players.* The first Attis legend dates from about the same time. At the end of the third century B. C. the goddess begins to be regarded as especially Phrygian, 96 but it is not until the time of Strabo and later that evidence appears of Phrygia's being regarded as the home _par excellence_ of the cult.
